Having previously learned `C` and `C++`, I've always been intrigued by `Assembly` but never had the chance to fully explore it.

This serves as my personal documentation progress for Assembly. You can check the `Assembly` files [here](https://jotavare.github.io/x86_assembly_nasm).

Another project I want to do after learning the basics of `Assembly` is redoing [Libft](https://github.com/jotavare/libft) and converting all 43 functions in `C` to `Assembly`, or at least trying to.
