## **x86 ASSEMBLY NASM**

Having previously learned `C` and `C++`, I've always been intrigued by `Assembly`.

This serves as my personal documentation progress for `x86 Assembly`, based on these [references](https://jotavare.github.io/docs/x86_assembly_nasm/references.html). You can check all the produced files [here](https://github.com/jotavare/x86-assembly-nasm).

Another project I want to do after learning the basics of `Assembly` is to redo my [Libft](https://github.com/jotavare/libft)[^postfix] and convert all functions from `C` to `x86 Assembly`, or at least try to. My progress will be available [here](https://github.com/jotavare/libft-x86-assembly).

[^postfix]:
    Libft is a library of basic functions written in **C**, commonly used in projects at **42** and other programming environments.
