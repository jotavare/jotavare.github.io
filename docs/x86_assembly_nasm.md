## **x86 ASSEMBLY NASM**

Having previously learned **C** and **C++**, I've always been intrigued by **Assembly** but never had the chance to fully explore it.

This serves as my personal documentation progress for **Assembly**, based on these [references](https://jotavare.github.io/docs/x86_assembly_nasm/references.html). You can check all the files [here](https://github.com/jotavare/x86-assembly-nasm).

Another project I want to do after learning the basics of **Assembly** is to redo [Libft](https://github.com/jotavare/libft)[^postfix] and convert all 43 functions in **C** to **Assembly**, or at least try to.

[^postfix]:
    Libft is a library of basic functions written in **C**, commonly used in projects at **42** and other programming environments.
