## **CALLING C FUNCTIONS**

### **C Function Definition**

When writing assembly code, I can **call standard C functions** like `printf` and `exit` using the `gcc` compiler but first I need a **few changes** in the code:

```
extern printf
extern exit

section .data
	msg DD "Hello World!", 0
	msg DD "Hello World!", 0
	fmt DB "Output is: %s %s",10,0

section .text

global main

main:
	PUSH msg
	PUSH fmt
	CALL printf
	PUSH 1
	CALL exit
```

- `extern` is used to tell the assembler that the **function is defined elsewhere**.
- `printf` and `exit` are functions that are defined in the **C standard library**.
- Instead of `global _start`, I need to use `global main` because the `gcc` compiler expects a `main` function.
- `PUSH` is used to **push data into the stack**.
- `CALL` is used to **call a function**.

----

### **Stack Usage**

The stack is a **Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)** data structure, meaning the **last item pushed** onto the stack is the **first one to be popped off**. Picture it like stacking plates in a cafeteria tray: the last plate you put on top is the first one you'll take off when you need it.

Let's take a look at the previous example, `printf` parameters are `printf(format, message)`. In my code, I first `PUSH msg` and then `PUSH fmt` onto the stack. This order **might seem counterintuitive** at first because I usually think of passing arguments in the order they are listed. However, the arguments are **pushed in reverse order**, ensuring that the function receives them in the correct sequence.

### **Compiling with GCC**

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
Generate the **object file** using `nasm` and **compile the final binary** using `gcc`:
</div>
```
nasm -f elf32 -o program_name.o program_name.s
gcc -no-pie -m32 -o program_name program_name.o 
```

- `-no-pie` flag is used to **disable** the **Position Independent Executable** feature.
- `-m32` flag specifies the target architecture as **32 bits for x86**.
- `-f` flag is used to specify the **output format**, in this case, `elf32`.

{:.important-title}
**Position Independent Executable (PIE)** is a feature that modern operating systems and compilers use to **randomize the base address of executables** in memory. This randomness helps to avoid **security attacks** like buffer overflow by making it difficult for attackers to predict memory layouts. However, in some cases, **fixed addresses** may be needed for **compatibility** or **performance reasons**.

### **Custom C Function Definition**

In this example, I have a `C` file named `sum.c` with a function named `sum` and as assembly file:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

extern int sum(int a, int b);

int sum(int a, int b) {
    printf("Here!\n");
    return (a + b);
}
```

```
extern sum
extern exit

section .data
section .text

global main

main:
    PUSH 1
    PUSH 2
    CALL sum
    PUSH eax
    CALL exit
```

{:.important-title}
- I declare this function as `extern` to make it accessible to our assembly program.
- I use the `call` instruction to call my custum `C` function `sum`.
- The `eax` register contains the return value of the function.

----

### **Compilation Process**

To compile and link our assembly code with our `C` file `sum.c`, follow these steps:

<div class="code-example" markdown="1">
Generate the **object file** using `nasm` and compile the `C` file and **link it with the object file**:
</div>
```bash
nasm -f elf32 -o first.o first.s
gcc -m32 -o first first.o sum.c -no-pie
```
