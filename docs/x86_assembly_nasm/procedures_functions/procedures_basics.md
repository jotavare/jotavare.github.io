## **PROCEDURES BASICS**

### **Defining Procedures**

A **procedure** in x86 assembly serves the same purpose as a **function** in higher-level languages. It encapsulates a **sequence of instructions** to perform a specific task.

In this example, I define a procedure named `addTwo`. The procedure adds the values stored in the `eax` and `ebx` registers and returns the result with `ret`.

```
addTwo:
    add eax, ebx
    ret
```

----

### **Calling Procedures**

To call a procedure, I use the `call` instruction followed by the **name of the procedure**.

```
addTwo:
    add eax, ebx
    ret

main:
    mov eax, 2
    mov ebx, 3
    call addTwo
```

When a procedure is called, the **return address is pushed onto the stack**. The `RET` instruction retrieves this **return address from the stack**, effectively returning control to the caller.

----

### **Debugging the Stack**

Let's use **GDB** to inspect the stack and understand how return addresses are managed. 

- `info register esp` - Displays the current value of the stack pointer `esp`;
- `x/x $esp` - Displays the value at the top of the stack;

Understanding how return addresses are stored on the stack is **crucial for computer security**. Exploits such as **buffer overflows** can manipulate return addresses to **execute malicious code**.

### **Example Code**

```
section .text
    global main

addTwo:             ; define a procedure called addTwo
    add eax, ebx    ; add the two arguments
    ret             ; return the result

main:
    mov eax, 4      ; set the first argument to 4
    mov ebx, 1      ; set the second argument to 1
    call addTwo     ; call the addTwo procedure
    mov ebx,eax     ; store the result of eax in ebx
    mov eax, 1      ; set eax to 1
    int 80h         ; exit the program, system call
```
