## **PROCEDURES BASICS**

### **Defining Procedures**

A **procedure** in x86 assembly serves the same purpose as a **function** in higher-level languages. It encapsulates a **sequence of instructions** to perform a specific task.

In this example I define a procedure named `add_two`. The procedure adds the values stored in the `eax` and `ebx` registers and returns the result.

```
add_two:
    ADD eax, ebx  ; Add the contents of eax and ebx
    RET           ; Return from the procedure
```

----

### **Calling Procedures**

To call a procedure, we use the `call` instruction followed by the **name of the procedure**. After the procedure execution, control returns to the instruction immediately following the `call`.

```
    MOV eax, 2      ; Set eax to 2
    MOV ebx, 3      ; Set ebx to 3
    CALL add_two    ; Call the add_two procedure
```

When a procedure is called, the **return address is pushed onto the stack**. The `RET` instruction retrieves this return address from the stack, effectively returning control to the caller.

----

### **Debugging and Stack Inspection**

If I use GDB, I can inspect the stack to understand how return addresses are managed. 

```bash
info register ESP   ; Get the current value of ESP
x/x [esp]           ; Inspect the value at ESP
```

- The stack pointer `esp` points to the top of the stack, where the return address is stored.

Understanding how return addresses are stored on the stack is crucial for computer security. Exploits such as buffer overflows can manipulate return addresses to execute malicious code.

### **End Code**

```
section .data

section .text

global main

addTwo:             ; define a function called addTwo
    add eax, ebx    ; add the two arguments
    ret             ; return the result

main:
    mov eax, 4  ; set the first argument to 4
    mov ebx, 1  ; set the second argument to 1
    call addTwo ; call the addTwo function
    mov ebx,eax ; store the result of eax in ebx
    mov eax, 1  ; set eax to 1
    int 80h     ; exit the program
```

If write on bash `echo $?` after running the program, it will print the return value of the program. In this case, it will print `5`. Which is the result of `4 + 1 = 5`.
