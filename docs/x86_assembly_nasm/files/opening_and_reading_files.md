## **OPENING AND READING FILES**

### **x86 System Call Table**

Before diving into code implementation, let's understand the system calls required. We'll refer to the x86 system call table to identify the appropriate values for our operations.

| %eax | Name      | Source                     | %ebx             | %ecx              | %edx    | %esx | %edi |
|:-----|:----------|:---------------------------|:-----------------|:------------------|:--------|:-----|:-----|
| 1    | sys_exit  | kernel/exit.c              | int              | -                 | -       | -    | -    |
| 2    | sys_fork  | arch/i386/kernel/process.c | struct pt_regs   | -                 | -       | -    | -    |
| 3    | sys_read  | fs/read_write.c            | unsigned int     | char *            | size_t  | -    | -    |
| 4    | sys_write | fs/read_write.c            | unsigned int     | const char *      | size_t  | -    | -    |
| 5    | sys_open  | fs/open.c                  | const char *     | int               | int     | -    | -    |
| ...  | ...       | ...                        | ...              | ...               | ...     | ...  | ...  |

We'll focus on the `open` and `read` system calls for file manipulation.

You can find the complete x86 system call table [here](https://faculty.nps.edu/cseagle/assembly/sys_call.html), [here](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/constants/syscalls.md), or [here](https://blog.rchapman.org/posts/Linux_System_Call_Table_for_x86_64/). Additionally, you can use the terminal command `man syscalls` to access the system call manual.

### **Opening a File**

If we use the terminal command `man 2 open` (also [here](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/open.2.html)), we'll find the following function:

```c
int open(const char *pathname, int flags);
```

So, we need the following information to open a file:
- `open` system call requires `eax` to be set to `5`;
- It takes a **file path** on `ebx` as a `const char *`;
- We need to provide a **flag** as argument to `ecx` as an `int`;

{: .important-title }
Flags are used to specify the mode in which the file should be opened. For example, `O_RDONLY` for read-only mode, `O_WRONLY` for write-only mode, and `O_RDWR` for read-write mode. I can check that in the terminal, using `man 2 open` and scrolling down to the `flags` section. One small thing is that in man pages, the flags are defined as `C macros`, but in assembly, we need to use the actual values. No worries, I can go to the `fcntl.h` file and find the actual value of `O_RDONLY` [here](https://sites.uclouvain.be/SystInfo/usr/include/asm-generic/fcntl.h.html) `00000000`.

```
section .data
    pathname db "path/to/file.txt"

section .text
    global main

main:
    mov eax, 5
    mov ebx, pathname
    mov ecx, 0
    int 80h
```

- The result of the system call will be the file descriptor as an `int`, which will be stored in `eax`.
- I can check with GDB using `x/10x [pointer]` to see the memory content in hexadecimal format or `x/10s [pointer]` to see the string content.

{: .important-title }
A file descriptor is a unique identifier assigned by the operating system to a file when it is opened. It is used to reference the file in subsequent operations. The first three file descriptors are reserved for standard input, output, and error streams (0, 1, and 2, respectively). The file descriptor returned by the `open` system call will be a positive integer greater than 2.

### **Reading from the File**

If we use the terminal command `man 2 read` (also [here](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html)), we'll find the following function:

```c
ssize_t read(int fd, void *buf, size_t count);
```

{: .important-title}
Since we now know the file descriptor (in this case `3`), we can read from the file using the `read` system call.

So, we need the following information to `read` from a file:
- `read` system call requires `eax` to be set to `3`;
- It takes the **file descriptor** on `ebx` as an `int`;
- I will need a **buffer** to store the data read from the file;
- The **size** of the buffer should be provided to `edx` as a `size_t`;

```
section .data
    pathname db "path/to/file.txt"

section .bss
    buffer resb 1024    ; Reserve 1024 bytes for the buffer because we don't know the file size

section .text
    global main

main:
    mov eax, 5          ; Open system call
    mov ebx, pathname   ; File path
    mov ecx, 0          ; Flags
    int 80h             ; Call the system

    mov ebx, eax        ; Store the file descriptor in ebx
    mov eax, 3          ; Read system call
    mov ecx, buffer     ; Buffer to store the data
    mov edx, 1024       ; Size of the buffer
    int 80h             ; Call the system

    mov eax, 1          ; Exit system call
    mov ebx, 0          ; Exit code (success)
    int 80h             ; Call the system
```

{: .important-title}
The result of the system call will be the number of bytes read, which will be stored in `eax`. If `eax` is `0`, it means that the end of the file has been reached. If `eax` is `-1`, it means that an error occurred. If `eax` is `-2`, it means that the file descriptor is invalid. So on...
