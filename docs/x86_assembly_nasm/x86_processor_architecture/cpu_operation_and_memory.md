## **CPU OPERATION AND MEMORY**

### **CPU Components**

The CPU comprises several crucial components:

- **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)**: Performs arithmetic and logical operations such as ADD, AND, OR, NOT, etc.
- **Control Unit**: Decodes instructions and directs operations to other CPU units or external devices.
- **Clock**: Generates regular pulses to synchronize operations within the CPU and across the system.
- **Memory Registers**: Fastest storage locations within the CPU used for temporary data storage and manipulation.

- Measured in Hertz, the clock speed determines the number of instructions a CPU can execute per second.
- One to zero and back to one is one clock cycle.
- The number of clock cycles per second, expressed in GHz (Gigahertz).
- Every time the clock ticks, the CPU processes an instruction.

### **Operation Execution**

Understanding the execution of instructions is important:

1. **Fetching**: Retrieve instructions from the instruction queue.
2. **Decoding**: Interpret the instruction and identify associated operands.
3. **Operand Retrieval**: Obtain necessary data from memory or registers.
4. **Execution**: Perform the specified operation.
5. **Status Update**: Update status flags based on the outcome of the operation.
6. **Result Storage**: Store the result if required.

This sequence, known as the **fetch-decode-execute** procedure, forms the basis of CPU operation.

### **Memory Access**

Reading from memory involves specific steps:

1. **Addressing**: Specify the memory address to read from.
2. **Assertion**: Signal the CPU's intent to read from memory.
3. **Waiting**: Allow time for memory to respond.
4. **Data Retrieval**: Copy data from the data bus to the destination.

**Memory access (RAM)** typically takes longer than register access due to the **additional steps involved**. Instead of executing only one instruction, I need to **execute multiple instructions** to access memory.

### **Caching**

To mitigate memory access latency, caching is employed:

- **Cache**: Stores frequently accessed data closer to the CPU, reducing read and write times.
- **Levels**: x86 architecture commonly features two cache levels:
  - **Level 1 Cache**: Located within the CPU for rapid access.
  - **Level 2 Cache**: External to the CPU but accessed via a high-speed bus, offering faster access than RAM.

**Static RAM** is often used in caches due to its **efficiency**, though it's **costlier** than dynamic RAM. **Dynamic RAM** is used in main memory due to its **lower cost** and **higher storage** capacity.
