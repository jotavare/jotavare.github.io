## **EFLAGS, ADD, and ADC**

### **EFlags**

This is a **32-bit register** in **x86 assembly** language that contains various flags providing information about the result of an operation. These flags are crucial for understanding the outcome of **arithmetic operations** and determining the **next steps in the program flow**.

| Flags | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| `CF`  | Carry flag, set when an arithmetic operation generates a carry or borrow. |
| `OF`  | Overflow flag, set when an operation generates a result too large for the destination register. |
| `SF`  | Sign flag, set when the result of an operation is negative. |
| `ZF`  | Zero flag, set when the result of an operation is zero. |
| `AC`  | Alignment check flag, set when an unaligned memory access occurs. |
| `PF`  | Parity flag, set when the least-significant byte of the result has an even number of set bits. |
| `IF`  | Interrupt flag, determines whether the CPU recognizes external interrupts. |

If the flag is set to `1`, it means the condition is met; otherwise, it's `0`. You can check more register flags [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLAGS_register).

### **ADD Operation**

The `add` instruction is used to perform addition operations in x86 assembly. Here's an example:

```
section .data

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    mov eax, 2      ; Load value 5 into eax
    mov ebx, 3      ; Load value 3 into ebx
    add eax, ebx    ; Add ebx to eax
```

{: .important-title }
This instruction adds the value in `ebx` to `eax` and stores the result in `eax`. So, after this operation, `eax` should contain the **sum of the two numbers** `5`. Also, we can represent a number like `2` in binary as `0b00000010` and in hexadecimal as `0x02`.

### Handling Carry Flag (CF)

The Carry Flag `CF` is another crucial aspect, especially when dealing with arithmetic operations involving limited register sizes. Consider a scenario where the result exceeds the capacity of the destination register.

```
section .data

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    mov al, 0xFF    ; Load value 255 into al
    mov bl, 1       ; Load value 1 into bl
    add al, bl       ; Add 1 to al
```

{: .important-title }
In this case, the result of the addition operation is `256`, which is too large to fit into the `al` register. In such cases, the extra bits are carried over and stored in the `CF` of the E-Flags register. We can utilize the `ADC` (Add with Carry) instruction to incorporate this carry into subsequent operations.

### **ADC Operation**

The `adc` instruction is used to perform addition operations with a carry in x86 assembly.

```
section .data

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    mov al, 0xFF    ; Load value 255 into al
    mov bl, 1       ; Load value 1 into bl
    add al, bl      ; Add 1 to al
    adc al, 0       ; Add the carry flag to the result
```

{: .important-title }
In this case, the `adc` instruction adds the value in the carry flag to the result of the previous addition operation. This allows us to handle scenarios where the result exceeds the capacity of the destination register and carry over the extra bits.

### **SUB Operation**

The `sub` instruction is used to perform subtraction operations in x86 assembly.

```
section .data

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    mov al, 5       ; Load value 5 into al
    mov bl, 3       ; Load value 3 into bl
    sub al, bl      ; Subtract 3 from 5
```

{: .important-title }
This instruction subtracts the value in `bl` from `al` and stores the result in `al`. So, after this operation, `al` should contain the **difference of the two numbers** `2`.

Now lets flip the numbers and see what happens:

```
section .data

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    mov al, 3       ; Load value 3 into al
    mov bl, 5       ; Load value 5 into bl
    sub al, bl      ; Subtract 5 from 3
```

{: .important-title }
In this case, the result of the subtraction operation is `-2`, which is a negative number. The `SF` (Sign Flag) in the E-Flags register will be set to `1` to indicate that the result is negative.

Another example, what if we move to ebx the number 2 and add to eax:

```
section .data

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    mov eax, 3      ; Load value 5 into eax
    mov ebx, 5      ; Load value 2 into ebx
    sub eax, ebx    ; Subtract 2 from 5
    mov ebx, 2      ; Load value 2 into ebx
    add eax, ebx    ; Add -2 to 2
```
