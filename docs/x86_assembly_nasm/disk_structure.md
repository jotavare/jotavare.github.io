## **DISK STRUCTURE**

   - Disks consist of stacked platters, each with **two heads** (top and bottom) for reading and writing data.
   - Platters are divided into **tracks**, which are further divided into **sectors**.
   - Sectors typically have a standard size, often **512 bytes**, determined by the file format.
   - Tracks stacked across multiple disks form a **cylinder**.

### **Addressing Schemes**

   - **Cylinder-Head-Sector (CHS):**
     - Used historically and for certain **legacy systems**.
     - Specifies the **cylinder, head, and sector** of data.
     - Helps locate data on a physical disk.
     - Useful for **partitioning** and older devices like floppy disks.

   - **Logical Block Addressing (LBA):**
     - A **linear addressing scheme** for modern disks, including SSDs and network drives.
     - Blocks are **indexed numerically**, starting from zero.
     - Offers easier **abstraction** and compatibility across different disk types.

### **Converting Between CHS and LBA**

   - **CHS to LBA:**
    - `LBA = (C * TH * TS) + (H * TS) + (S - 1)`
    - `C` - Cylinder, `H` - Head, `S` - Sector, `TH` - Total Heads, `TS` - Total Sectors.

   - **LBA to CHS:**
     - `T` = `LBA / Sectors per Track`
     - `S` = `(LBA % Sectors per Track) +1`
     - `H` = `(T % Number of Heads)`
     - `C` = `(T / Number of Heads)`

### **Practical Application**
   - Understanding both addressing schemes is crucial for interacting with disk data through **system calls** and **interrupts**.
   - Converting between CHS and LBA enables **compatibility** and efficient data access across different systems and storage devices.
