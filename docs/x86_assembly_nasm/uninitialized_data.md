## **UNINITIALIZED DATA**

{: .important-title }
If you're into exploring **binary, decimal, and hexadecimal numbers**, there's a handy [online converter](https://www.mathsisfun.com/binary-decimal-hexadecimal-converter.html) you can use. It's perfect for tinkering with different number systems and understanding how they work.

### **BSS Section**

In **x86 assembly**, sometimes we need to **reserve memory** for potential data storage without initializing it to specific values. This is where the **BSS section** comes into play.

```
section .bss
    num resb 3      ; Reserves three bytes of memory for 'num'

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    mov bl, 1       ; Move the value 1 into bl
    mov [num], bl   ; Move the value in bl into the memory space reserved for 'num'
    mov [num+1], bl ; Move the value in bl into the next byte of 'num'
    mov [num+2], bl ; Move the value in bl into the second next byte of 'num'

                    ; Exiting the program
    mov eax, 1      ; Move 1 to eax
    int 80h         ; Interrupt
```

In x86 assembly, **sizes are not inherently understood**, so we need to provide context for data manipulation. That's why we first move the value `1` into the `bl` register and then transfer it into the memory space reserved for `num`. To access a **specific byte** of `num`, we can utilize expressions like `[num+1]` or `[num+2]` to reference the subsequent bytes in memory.

### **Initializing Data (alternative)**

Alternatively, we can initialize data with default values using the `section .data`. Instead of manually reserving and setting values, we can use the `dup` instruction to initialize memory with the specified value.

```
section .data
    num2 db 3 dup (2) ; Initializes 'num2' with three instances of the value 2

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    mov bl, 1       ; Move the value 1 into bl
    mov [num2], bl  ; Move the value in bl into the memory space reserved for 'num2'

    mov [num], bl   ; Move the value in bl into the memory space reserved for 'num'
    mov [num+1], bl ; Move the value in bl into the next byte of 'num'
    mov [num+2], bl ; Move the value in bl into the second next byte of 'num'

                    ; Exiting the program
    mov eax, 1      ; Move 1 to eax
    int 80h         ; Interrupt
```
