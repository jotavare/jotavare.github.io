## **SIMPLE BOOTLOADER**

### **Bootloader Process**

Bootloaders are programs responsible for **initializing hardware** and **starting the operating system**.

When a PC boots in **legacy mode**, the following sequence occurs:

1. It enters the **BIOS** (Basic Input Output System);
2. The **BIOS** initiates the boot process by accessing the **boot sequence**, which determines the order in which devices are checked for **bootable code**;
3. Each device in the boot sequence is accessed, and its first sector, known as the **MBR** (Master Boot Record), is loaded into memory at address `0x7c00`.
4. The BIOS checks for a signature `0xaa55` at the end of the `512 byte` sector loaded into memory at `0x7c00`;
5. If the signature is found, the BIOS transfers control to the bootloader code at memory address `0x7c00`, initiating the execution of the bootloader;

In the context of traditional **x86 BIOS bootloaders**, the bootloader is typically `512 bytes` in size. This is because the **MBR**, which contains the bootloader code, occupies the first sector `512 bytes` of a storage device such as a hard disk or a floppy disk.

### **Project Structure**

- **Build Folder**: Files generated during the build process, like `img` and `bin`;
- **Source Folder**: Source code for the bootloader, example `simple_bootloader.asm`;
- **Makefile**: This file automates the build process, it's called `Makefile`;

----

### **Writing the Bootloader**

To create the bootloader, I will follow these steps:

- Use `org` directive to set the origin address to `0x7c00`;
- Set the processor mode to `bits 16`;
- Use `hlt` to halt the CPU after execution;
- Create an infinite loop using `jmp halt` to ensure the CPU remains halted;
- Fill the remaining space in the `512 byte` sector with **zeros** using `times 510-($-$$) db 0`;
- Add the signature `dw 0xaa55` at the end of the bootloader;

```
org 0x7c00
bits 16

main:
    hlt

halt:
    jmp halt

    times 510-($-$$) db 0
    dw 0xaa55
```

`org` is used to specify the **origin address**, **starting address** for the code or **data that follows it**. In this case, I set the origin address to `0x7c00` to align with the memory location where the bootloader is loaded.

`16 bits` is the standard **processor mode** for bootloaders, ensuring **compatibility with legacy systems**. After that, depending on the operating system, the **processor mode** can be switched to `32 bits` or `64 bits`.

### **Writing the Makefile**
To build the bootloader and automate the process, I need to create a `Makefile`:

```makefile
# Assembler
ASM=nasm

# Directories
SRC_DIR=src
BUILD_DIR=build

# Targets
$(BUILD_DIR)/main.img: $(BUILD_DIR)/main.bin
	cp $(BUILD_DIR)/main.bin $(BUILD_DIR)/main.img
	truncate -s 1440k $(BUILD_DIR)/main.img

# Build
$(BUILD_DIR)/main.bin: $(SRC_DIR)/main.asm
	$(ASM) $(SRC_DIR)/main.asm -f bin -o $(BUILD_DIR)/main.bin
```

### **Running the Bootloader**
To test the bootloader, I use an emulator like `qemu`:

```bash
qemu-system-i386 -fda build/main.img
```

- `qemu-system-i386` is the emulator to run the bootloader in **x86 mode**;
- `-fda` specifies the floppy disk image to boot from;
- `build/main.img` is the path to the floppy disk image;

`qemu` is a popular emulator that can run **x86 operating systems**. I can also run the bootloader on real hardware by writing the image to a USB drive.
