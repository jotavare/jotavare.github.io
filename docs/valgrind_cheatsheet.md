## **VALGRIND CHEATSHEET**

Just like with GDB, I couldn't find a Valgrind reference that suited my needs. So, I took matters into my own hands and created this cheatsheet. It's a curated list of optimized Valgrind commands along with their descriptions, all based on various [references](https://jotavare.github.io/valgrind_cheatsheet/references.html) I found.

This cheatsheet is meant to be a quick reference guide for Valgrind memory debugging, whether you're a beginner or an experienced user. I hope it helps streamline your debugging process. Happy debugging!

Check the original [Valgrind Manual](https://valgrind.org/docs/manual/manual.html) for more detailed information.
