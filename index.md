# **THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY**

Hey there! This project initially served as a testing ground for GitHub Pages and Jekyll. However, it evolved into something more significant. I realized the potential to transform the documentation I already had scattered across various GitHub repositories into a unified, easily searchable website format. Thus, this platform serves as a comprehensive documentation hub, packed with resources, guides, cheat sheets, and more, all tailored for personal use.

My aim is to document everything essential to my journey - from my experiences at 42 school to my personal hobbies and work-related insights. Your suggestions are always welcome, and any contributions you make are highly valued.

I hope this platform can help you on your journey, sparing you the struggles I faced in scouring for information. Happy coding!
