## **TIPS**

- Output Line Numbers:
    - Refactor: Compile with `-g` flag for debug information.
- Slow Programs:
    - Refactor: Test with small workloads to isolate issues. Profile code for bottlenecks.
- Error Overload:
    - Refactor: Fix initial errors to potentially resolve subsequent ones.
- Valgrind Integration:
    - Refactor: Use Valgrind's `--vgdb-error` and `--vgdb-stop-at` options for GDB debugging integration.
